Greetings!

This is my first GitHub project!
An android application that allows you to use your phone as a punch in card for work.
After you successfully punch in, you have access to work related events such as meetings
or email reminders.

Currently established:
1. Functional users database.
2. Login and regisration work correctly when the database is up.

Improvements that need to be made:
1. Syncing the phone with the NFC Reader (Currently using the ACR122U ACS NFC USB Reader)
    Need to figure out what to use as a tag to initiate connection and punch in with phone.
2. Create a Java based web application linked with the mobile app
   in order to connect web and mobile for user.
